## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn based on various factors using machine learning models. Customer churn prediction enables companies to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, optimizing customer service strategies and boosting engagement. 

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses customer data, including handling missing values and engineering features.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Trains and evaluates multiple ML models, selecting the best-performing one for deployment.
3. **Web App Deployment**: Offers real-time predictions through a user-friendly web app built on Replit.
4. **LLM Integration**: Generates explanations for model predictions and personalized customer emails.
5. **API Integration**: (Optional) Host the model on a cloud service, making it accessible to other applications.

## Data
Weâ€™re using a customer churn dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes various features about customer demographics, account information, and service usage details. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/). Ensure that you place the data file in the `data/` directory after downloading.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset** and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run initial data exploration** (optional):
   ```bash
   python src/data_exploration.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**  
   Train different models by running:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Models**  
   Evaluate the models using:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

4. **Run the Web App**  
   To serve the model predictions through a web app, run:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the web app.

## Model Training
The model training process involves:
1. Training multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM).
2. Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to identify the best-performing model.
3. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The best-performing model will be deployed in the web app.

## Web App Deployment
We use Replit to deploy the web app. The app allows users to input customer data and get real-time churn predictions. It also displays predictions and model explanations in a user-friendly interface.

## Model Interpretation with LLM
An LLM (Language Learning Model) is integrated to provide interpretability for the model predictions:
- Generates an explanation for each prediction, offering transparency on why a customer may be likely to churn.
- Generates personalized email content to engage the customer and offer tailored retention strategies.

## Challenges & Advanced Techniques
This project includes several advanced features for further exploration:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
2. **Advanced ML Models**: Train GradientBoostingClassifier, StackingClassifier, etc., and compare their performance.
3. **Enhanced LLM Integration**: Use advanced LLMs to improve the quality of explanations and emails.
4. **Cloud API Hosting**: Host the model as an API for integration with other web apps.
5. **Dataset Experimentation**: Train on different datasets and optimize for best results.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For ML model implementation.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data preprocessing.
- **Flask**: For building the web app.
- **Replit**: For deploying the web app.
- **LLM Integration**: For generating explanations and emails.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Improve the web app with data visualizations for better user interaction.
- **Automated Model Retraining**: Add periodic retraining to adapt to new customer data.
- **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized emails.
- **Custom LLM Integration**: Fine-tune a custom LLM specifically for churn prediction.
